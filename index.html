      <p>I am a person looking to make a direction change at this point in my life.  I have been in many industries in my adult life.  I hava a Bachelors in Business Administration from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  I majored in Finance and Risk Management.  I was first in the pension industry for a couple of years right out of college.  I changed into public accounting where I did earn the CPA designation.  After five years I decided to become more independent and became a realtor.  I sold houses for 13 years. </p>
      <p>I then decided I wanted to see more of the country so I became a truck driver.  I have now been all over the country so now I am turning my interests to the technology field.  In college, I worked as a consultant in the computer lab in the Business school.  I have used many different software programs and found it easy to figure out the nuances of many different programs.  I am now announcing to the world that the technology industry is where I am supposed to be.</p>
